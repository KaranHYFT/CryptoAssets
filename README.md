# Assessing User Attitude and Emergence of CryptoAssets

One of the most recent developments in the world-wide technical environment for the virtual community has been
noticed in terms of transacting and settling through Cryptoassets,
which are a type of virtual currency. Because cryptoassets research is progressing, it is critical to appraise existing cryptoassets
research and identify prospective future study fields. In this paper
we have discussed about the major influential adoption factors
for crypto and the challenges faced, summing up to the future
scope and survey results of the asset class. Furthermore, this
article seeks to answer two difficult questions: ”What are the
foundations on which online users choose to use and/or mine
their cryptocurrency?” and ”Which factors have a significant
impact on the coin’s popularity and value?” We have used
various approaches to get views from the crypto community
which mainly includes data collected from various national and
international publications, financial and legal websites, Online
survey responses from telegram, reddit and twitter community
and, offline questionnaire with friends and relatives from crypto
space.

## Roadmap

- As this is our first foray into crypto space, several of the survey questions were overly specialised and limited to cryptoassets and mining. To gain a better grasp of the world of cryptoassets, an updated survey should be conducted in the future by generalising these questions and adding more questionnaires.

- Another worthwhile consideration for future work, Include a large and varied space of audience in the survey through a large advertisement survey platform.

-  Research people’s opinions about bitcoin in the Middle East, as this region currently lacks major involvement in cryptoassets.

- Fast mining with the same level of reliability.

- Solve the fork after withholding attack and the feather forking attack.

## Acknowledgements

 - First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Trevor Tomesh for giving me this wonderful opportunity. If it were not for them, I would not have been doing this project all. Along with giving me this project, Dr. Tomesh have given me valuable information, Support and guidance, Which has immensely helped and encouraged me in completing this survey project in the given duration.
 - It is very difficult to express my feelings and I feel short of words for those who have contributed towards my survey and provided their invaluable co-operation and view points to me. Many people have helped; provided direction as well as technical information and I take pleasure in acknowledging the role of people involved, directly or indirectly in the development of this project.

## Project Status

- #### Sprint 1 (Successfully Completed)
    Project surveyed small scale
- #### Sprint 2 (Future Enhancement)
    Planned to cover more ground and update questionnaire scope
